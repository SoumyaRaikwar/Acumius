### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Developer Certificate of Origin. This is a binding statement that asserts that you are the creator of your contribution, and that you have the right to submit it to the project under the open-source license.

To sign off your commits, use the `-s` or `--signoff` flag when committing:
```bash
git commit -s -m "feat(core): add semantic memory search"
```

This will add the following line to your commit message:
`Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>`

Pull requests with commits that do not include a sign-off will fail the CI checks.

### Pull Requests

1. Every PR needs at least one review
2. All CI checks must pass
3. Reference issues: `Closes #N`
4. Include tests for new code
5. Update documentation if needed

## Track Ownership

| Track | Scope | Lead |
|-------|-------|------|
| `track:core` | Go memory engine, storage, distillation | @core-lead |
| `track:protocol` | MCP server, REST API, SDKs | @protocol-lead |
| `track:adapters` | Framework adapters, DX, examples | @adapters-lead |
| `track:governance` | React UI, policy engine | @ui-lead |
| `track:bench` | Benchmark CLI, CI quality gates | @bench-lead |

## Testing

We take code quality seriously. Like many major open-source projects, we require comprehensive tests for all new features and bug fixes.

```bash
make test          # Run all tests (includes race detector)
make test-coverage # Run tests and generate an HTML coverage report
make bench         # Run benchmarks
```

**Testing Requirements for PRs:**
- **Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage (>80%) on new code. Check this locally using `make test-coverage`.
- **Integration**: If modifying database schemas or cache layers, ensure you write or update corresponding integration tests.
- **CI/CD**: Our GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs `make check` (which includes `make test` and `make lint`) on every PR. Your PR will be blocked from merging if tests fail or if your code does not pass linting.

## Migrations

```bash
make migrate-create name=add_new_table
# Edit migrations/00000X_add_new_table.up.sql
# Edit migrations/00000X_add_new_table.down.sql
make migrate       # Run pending migrations
```

## Code Style

- Go: `gofmt`, `go vet`, `golint`
- Error handling: always check, wrap with context
- No panics in production code
- Comments on exported functions
- Tests: table-driven, use `testify/assert`
